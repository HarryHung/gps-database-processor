# GPS Database Processor - Work-In-Progress

GPS Database Processor is an all-in-one tool for processing GPS ([Global Pneumococcal Sequencing Project](https://www.pneumogen.net/gps/)) database updates. 

This tool takes the GPS database's three `.csv` (comma-separated values) source files as input:
- `table1.csv` - metadata
- `table2.csv` - QC
- `table3.csv` - analysis

The tool carries out several operations in the following order:
1. Validation of columns and values in the `.csv` files
   - The terminal output displays any unexpected or erroneous values
   - If there are any critical errors, the tool will terminate its process and will not carry out the subsequent operations
2. Generate `table4.csv` based on inferred data
3. Generate [Monocle](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/monocle)-ready CSV files for all tables
   - Removing non-public data
   - Adding column(s) required by Monocle
4. Generate `data.json` for GPS Database Overview (upcoming project)
